        Hi............
    </h1>
    <b>wish there was a way I could show you how important you are in my life<br>
        I hope you remain my best friend till the end of time.<br>
        Whenever I need emotional support, you are always there for me.<br> 
        Even if you don’t say a word I usually feel relieved.<br> 
        I’m lucky that I have you Naveed!<br>
        The only person in the whole world who knows me better than anyone else is you. That’s why I never want to lose you.<br>
        You are the only person who gives me the confidence that i need in life to face challenges.<br> 
        Thank you for being such an amazing person.
